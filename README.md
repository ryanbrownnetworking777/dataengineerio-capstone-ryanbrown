# LORE (Scenario)

Bakehouse Central is where your inner Cookie Monster hangs out. They operate stalls in various train stations and smaller outfits **on the trains themselves** in the Northeastern US, UK, China, and Japan. 
A significantly popular chain, they enjoy a large loyalty program membership and high usage of their Bakehouse Central app.  

They operate a data lakehouse, affectionately called the "Data Bakehouse" to store and perform analytics and other business functions off of their enterprise data across these four countries. 

Their engineers have pioneered new ovens and other robotic machinery to propel on-site production to insane heights. Near real-time production of tasty treats is now possible both on and off train.  

Following the success of promotional campaigns tying an event with the arrival of a specific train in each of the markets, management has descended into madness. 

Management has now several demands for a new analytics and data-empowered business intiatives. 

- Real time alignment of trains to production of baked goods, ideally with suggested commemerative treats for their loyalty members. (Operational Data use case)
- Updates on sales and profitability of each stores. (Analytics Use Case) 
- Down to machine level operational visibility for supply and demain planners.  
- Hourly refreshing dashboards
